# BTDA Project - BYOB

This project aims to build a simple blockchain using [Substrate](https://substrate.io/). The blockchain will be used to store and manage the data of a simple decentralized application (dApp) that allows users (academic institutions) to store and verify the data of their students (e.g. certificates, diplomas, etc.).
